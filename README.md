# Google-books
# Google Books UI
# MVP:
Create a page that allows users to search for books
Page should include the following:
Header section introducing the page
Form containing a text input and a submit / search button
A grid of books
# Instructions:
When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then
# Styling (required):
This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and plan out your design. You can use tools like Figma or wireframe pro to plan what your application is going to look like.
Styling must use BEM, and each block should have its own SCSS file
Your palette should use variables
# Application Design (required):
You should separate DOM functions and non-DOM functions in different modules
Write as many non-DOM functions as you can
Functions should do 1 thing, and should be as pure and reusable as possible
Always use iterators over loops
Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.
