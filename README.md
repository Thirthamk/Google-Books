# Google Books UI
# MVP:
Create a page that allows users to search for books
Page should include the following:
Header section introducing the page
Form containing a text input and a submit / search button
A grid of books

#Specifications:
When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then

# Styling (required):
For styling I have used BEM, and each block has its own SCSS file

# Future goals / changes 
I have currently done basic styling, I would like to use more features, icons and make the website look more fun.
